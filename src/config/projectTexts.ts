      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>TOMI is my graduation project—a sculptural, totem-like object designed as first aid for stress and anxiety. It mediates calming interaction between parent and child through simple touch gestures such as tapping, pressing, and stroking.</p>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>The main challenges were designing a product suitable for both adults and children, balancing playfulness with maturity while maintaining a homely presence, and ensuring the object invites touch and communicates its use intuitively. Another challenge was relieving stress for both parent and child without shifting responsibility onto the child.</p>

      </div>
      
      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <p>The final design consists of three large wooden beads, each dedicated to a different calming action. Their tactile qualities—natural wood, soft textiles, and rounded forms—invite intuitive use. The modular system creates a sense of wholeness, while allowing the parent and child to use each element separately or together.</p>
      
      <h3>Techniques</h3>
      <p>The fabrication process combined traditional craftsmanship with advanced manufacturing methods. The wooden elements were shaped on a lathe in collaboration with a professional carpenter, while wool felt was sewn and integrated to create soft, tactile surfaces. Custom molds were designed and 3D printed, then used to cast medical-grade silicone parts, resulting in precise and durable components.</p>

      <p>The project combined digital fabrication with textile craftsmanship. TPU 3D printing was used to create flexible grip textures, while laser cutting provided precision in shaping fabrics and straps. Sewing reinforced the straps, and embroidery added a distinctive logo detail. In addition, standard 3D printing with spray painting was applied for structural parts and visual accents.</p>
